# How to recursively see the contents of this directory and his subdirectory

**Interviewer questions:**

---
* Who is Root? 
* How to execute the command on his behalf?

**Your answer:**

Root user is the most privileged user in a Linux or Unix system. 
It has full access to all system resources, 
including user accounts and files. 
To execute commands on behalf of the root user,
the user must use the command `sudo` (substitute user do).
This will allow the user to execute commands as if they were the root user.
